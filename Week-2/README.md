## Project Description

- The Report Card Generator is a simple JavaScript program that allows users to enter a student’s name and score. Based on the score, the program automatically calculates the grade (A, B, C, D, or F) and displays a formatted report card.

- This project demonstrates the use of variables, conditional statements, and string concatenation in JavaScript. It’s a beginner-friendly program that shows how logic and user input can be combined to generate meaningful output.
